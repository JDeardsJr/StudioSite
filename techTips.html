                    <p>While there are quite a few tips and tricks that can prove useful to the virtual lesson experience, the main requirements for students are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A device with video and audio capabilities</li>
                        <li>A space where you feel comfortable and focused</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Our virtual lessons can be taken using laptops, desktops, tablets, and cell phones. Here are a few tips and best practices to ensure you get the most out of your lessons.</p>

                    <h3>Tech Tips:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If you are able, use a laptop or desktop. Computers are preferred to other devices as they will allow you a larger screen to view your teacher and generally have better sound and video qualities. Ensure that whatever device you are using has video and audio capabilities.
                        </li>
                        <li>If you are on a computer, using an ethernet cord connected to your router will provide a faster/more stable connection. This is especially helpful for sound quality in voice lessons.</li>
                        <li>If using WiFi, consider establishing yourself as close to the router as possible if able to create an appropriate space.</li>
                        <li>Consider asking roommates/housemates to be aware of WiFi usage during lessons, especially if they are streaming, as this will slow down your internet speed.</li>
                        <li>For a cleaner sound for voice and acting lessons, consider using headphones along with a USB microphone, or headphones with a built-in mic.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Setting Up Your Home Lesson Space:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If you are able, try to set up for your lessons in a quiet place, free from distractions.</li>
                        <li>For voice and acting lessons, you may be seated for part or all of the lesson, depending on the activity. Try to use a chair that will allow for good posture and allows your feet to touch the ground</li>
                        <li>For voice and acting lessons, your teacher may also ask you to stand. If you are able, make a lesson space that allows you step back from the computer so your head and torso may be viewed by the teacher.</li>
                        <li>For tap lessons, you will need a space with a hard surface to tap on, approximately 5x5 feet to move in, and set far enough from the screen so your whole body may be viewed by the teacher.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>The Zoom Platform:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We use Zoom for all of our lessons at <span class="logo-styling">JDStudios</span>. The student does not need to create an account. A monthly code will be emailed to the student (or parent/guardian if student is a minor). The student can log in to their lesson by clicking the link in the email or by inputting the code into the Zoom App on their device. </li>
                        <li>A “waiting room” will be enabled for all lessons. Please feel free to log in to your lesson early to ensure an on-time lesson start. Your teacher will admit you at your scheduled time.</li>
                        <li>For safety reasons, we ask that students name themselves with their first and last name to ensure that only the student who is scheduled is admitted to the class at the appropriate time. If you are using an existing account, please ensure that the user’s name reflects the student’s name before joining the lesson. If you do not have an account, Zoom will ask for the user’s name when starting the meeting and the student should list their name at that time.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="considerations">Special Considerations for Voice Lessons:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At this time, video conferencing platforms are currently designed for speech exclusively. Their software is intended to make speech as intelligible as possible and minimize background noise. Because singing is sustained for much longer and varies in volume and pitch considerably more than everyday speech, the programs try to “correct” these variations. At your first lesson, your teacher will guide you through a few audio settings within Zoom to help adjust these settings and optimize the sound quality.</li>
                        <li>As mentioned above in “Tech Tips,” for a cleaner sound, consider using headphones along with a USB microphone, or headphones with a built-in mic. If you do not already have an external microphone and would like to invest in one either now or in the future, your teacher can guide you to some options that are conducive to singing, specifically.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="bold">*As always, please reach out to our General Manager if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
