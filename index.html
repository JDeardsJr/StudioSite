I have a Bachelor of Music in Vocal Performance from Biola University and earned my Master of Music in Musical Theater from Oklahoma City University.  <span class="about-second-sentence">In addition to performing in both musicals and operas, Iâ€™ve enjoyed teaching one-on-one voice lessons,Â leading group voice, piano, and musical theater classes, and working as a music director and vocal coach for numerous adult and children's theatre productions.</span></p>  
                        <p>Since I began teaching in 2008, I've had the privilege of working with hundreds of students with widely differing skill levels and musical backgrounds and I am passionate about helping each of my students reach their personal goals, learn healthy vocal technique, and gain confidence in their singing abilities. I look forward to talking with you about your musical background, interests, and goals.</p>

                        <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Laurie! Growing up in a community theatre environment, I was beyond excited to get my first pair of tap shoes when I was six years old â€“ and Iâ€™ve had a pair within reach ever since!  <span class="about-second-sentence">My earliest teaching experience was assisting with instruction for beginning and intermediate tappers. While earning a degree at Cal Poly Pomona (B.A. in English, Education Emphasis), I taught performance skills to young people in elementary, middle, and high school settings. As a choreographer for local musical theatre productions, Iâ€™ve now been able to dance with people of all ages.</span></p>  
                        <p>I love teaching movement skills to performers. Iâ€™m dedicated to seeing each learner as an individual, helping them to succeed and feel their best while dancing. We work together to build safe, sustainable habits and find joy in movement!</p>

                        <p>Welcome to JD Studios! I'm Jeff. Having grown up in the So Cal community theatre scene, I attended California State University Fullerton where I graduated with a BFA in Musical Theatre and spent the next several years performing professionally on both coasts.  <span class="about-second-sentence">Along with my on-stage theatrical work, I've had the opportunity to appear as a featured vocalist for the Florida Orchestra's Holiday Pops concert, as well as perform in Europe where I recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios.</span></p>  
                        <p>In addition to performing, I have had the privilege of spending the last several years teaching, directing, and producing both youth and adult theatre.  I particularly love working with students and actors to help build their skills, gain confidence on stage and tell clear, captivating, stories.  As the General Manager of JDStudios, I'm here to assist you so please feel free to reach out at any time!</p>
